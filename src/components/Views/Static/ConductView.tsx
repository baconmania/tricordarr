            JoCo Cruise is dedicated to fostering a diverse, safe and welcoming environment for all attendees regardless
            of race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, body size or type, neurotype,
            physical appearance, or religion; this extends to your interactions with fellow attendees.
          </BoldText>{' '}
          Invite people into your conversations and activities; be supportive when your fellow attendees try new things
          (or choose not to); participate, connect, help out. Events like these can feel lonely and intimidating when
          you’re new and don’t know anybody. Be welcoming, inclusive and friendly, and look out for one another!

          <BoldText>Don’t harass others.</BoldText> We are not a community that tolerates harassment. This includes (but
          isn’t limited to): any kind of physical, verbal, or psychological abuse; threats, intimidation, and bullying;
          slurs about race, gender, sexuality or ability; unwanted romantic attention, sexual harassment, and generally
          creepy or stalky behavior; and photographing anyone or engaging in physical interactions (hugging, tickling,
          backrubs, etc.) without consent. If someone asks you to stop doing something and you keep doing it, that’s
          harassment. We’re all responsible for making sure this doesn’t occur in our community.

          and/or crew, we must defer to the Nieuw Amsterdam management. The ship’s management, the officers, and crew
          are all ultimately responsible for the safety and well-being of every person on board. We and they are all
          doing our best to ensure you enjoy your experience and that the values of our community are upheld.

          Our experience and expectation is that JoCo Cruisers act responsibly and look after one another. But in the
          event of a breach of this Code of Conduct, we reserve the right to take action, including (but not limited to)
          limiting access to events, expulsion without refund, and/or permanent banning from JoCo Cruise events.

          During the cruise, if you are subject to or witness behavior that violates our Code of Conduct, contact any
          Helper or JoCo Cruise staff member; alternately, you can submit a Code of Conduct Violation Report form at the
          JoCo Cruise Info Desk. (You may submit this report anonymously if you prefer.) You can also dial 74501 from
          any ship’s phone. Off-ship, you can email conduct@jococruise.com. JoCo Cruise will make every effort to
          protect the privacy of anyone reporting a violation.
