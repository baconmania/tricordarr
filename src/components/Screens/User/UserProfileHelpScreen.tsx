        <HelpTopicView>
          Share as much or as little information about yourself as you'd like with your fellow passengers. All fields

        <HelpTopicView title={'Viewing a Profile'}>

        </HelpTopicView>
        <HelpTopicView title={'Private Note'}>
          You can save a note about a user that is visible only to you. For example: "Met at the Lido Bar on Monday,
          interested in my D&D campaign".
        </HelpTopicView>
        <HelpChapterTitleView title={'Relations'} />
        <HelpTopicView title={'Block'} icon={AppIcons.block}>
          Blocking a user will hide all that user's content from you, and also hide all your content from them.
        </HelpTopicView>
        <HelpTopicView title={'Mute'} icon={AppIcons.mute}>
          Muting a user will hide all that user's content from you.

        <HelpTopicView title={'Favorite'} icon={AppIcons.favorite}>
          Favoriting a user allows them to call you (between iOS devices only). Otherwise does nothing.
