Nightly
* lfg card really needs to go back to the event day screen
* Forum screen changes are laggy. May be because I'm aggressively clearing state? Just browsing forums
* View in Thread has started loading previous without the button. Search posts. OK yeah it's only only with search. Your Posts are fine
* Favkriting events is super slow
* Switches for find and joined lfgs in schedule
