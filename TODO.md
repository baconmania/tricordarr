* Forum screen changes are laggy. May be because I'm aggressively clearing state? Just browsing forums
* Favoriting events is super slow
* Changing forum filter is locking up the app
* Forum filter open triggering refresh
  * Same with sort 
* forum thread list cross contamination between screens
  * one context for each screen, make a dispatchAll in the provider?
* markdown text color in light mode
* LFG filters cross contaminate state - ended up with an Owned screen of Finds
* refresh main screen fetch blocks/reports/mutes
* Add a reverse sort order. Take whatever is there and reverse it. Could be weird with pagination.
  * Consider making it a Swiftarr feature instead
* Lost the new marker in forum thread view
