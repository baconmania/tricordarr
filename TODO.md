Nightly
* lfg card really needs to go back to the event day screen
* Forum screen changes are laggy. May be because I'm aggressively clearing state? Just browsing forums
* Favoriting events is super slow
* Kill the event favorite snack bar
* Why does refreshing for forum favorite not spin?
* Your day today sets a surprise filter that feels kinda weird.
* Loading a forum view triggers refresh briefly after initial render
* Allow non Ssl servers in Dev mode validation.
* Long press a forum list data item in the flatlist to bring up menu to favorite/mute/etc.
* Refresh a forum thread screen does not update read state. Still showing the new divider
* Schedule long press being problematic. Sometimes doesn't register. Is douvle tap a thing?
* clear oobe server healthcheck between changes
* forumcategoryscreen needs categoryID only to enable linking
